   Built a modular, locally hosted AI agent capable of multi-step reasoning and autonomous tool use, deployed via a Streamlit web interface using LlamaIndex, Ollama, and ChromaDB.
  </p>

### Description:
This capstone project focused on building an intelligent Agentic AI system capable of autonomous reasoning and decision-making using local LLMs. By leveraging the ReAct architecture, the system simulates thoughtâ€“observationâ€“action loops to answer complex user queries using both logic functions and web search tools.

The agent was integrated into a Streamlit web app and augmented with additional features like date retrieval and error handling. Additionally, a custom RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline was developed using LlamaIndex, embedding models from HuggingFace, and persistent vector storage with ChromaDB.

#### Key highlights include:

- Implemented a ReAct agent that chains together tools like add, multiply, and DuckDuckGo Search using FunctionTool
- Hosted and queried open-source LLMs like Llama3.2 and Phi3-Mini using Ollama locally
- Built a local RAG pipeline that loads documents, splits them into semantic chunks, indexes them, and retrieves relevant context dynamically
- Created an interactive Streamlit frontend for natural language Q&A with memory and dynamic agent routing
- Experimented with prompt tuning, Top-K, Top-P, and temperature settings to optimize output quality

This project highlights hands-on experience in deploying autonomous AI agents, integrating open-source AI models, and bridging backend logic with a user-facing app.
